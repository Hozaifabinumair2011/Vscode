If we waste our time, we get stressed out doing the important and necessary activities for the day. 
We also need time to relax and sleep so that we may be refreshed and rejuvenated otherwise we will not be able to work at our optimal and most productive level. 
Therefore it is important to manage our time well.Hi my name is hozaifaHi my name is hozaifaHi my name is hozaifaHi my name is hozaifa
